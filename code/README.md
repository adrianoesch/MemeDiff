InnoDiffSim.m is the main file for running our simulation. At the current state
it loads the exact network and personal preference vector into Matlab via csvread
from files in the "data" folder.

The other .m files are functions that are called from within the main file.

The R files are for statistical analysis of the results and putting them in nice
LaTex tables.
